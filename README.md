*recordit was not functional for my device for some reason and this was the best that I could do using screentogif.com, the video does not show sound but if you demo the code you will see that it is sound functional. 

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

I looked through some of the JavaScript random documentation along with JavaScript documentation, but ultimately did not end up using any of the 
random function that I generated as I prefered being able to manually choose the pattern and I wanted to turn in the most fun
version of the game that I could create. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I spent a good portion of my time working on this project experimenting with some of the optional features
